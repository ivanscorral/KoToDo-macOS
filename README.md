# KoToDo

KoToDo is a simple macOS todo logging client, written in Swift, designed to interface with [KoToDo Server](https://github.com/ivanscorral/kotodo-server).

## Description

The project uses Swift and SwiftUI. The application displays a dynamic navigation bar.

When the user is not logged in, the navigation bar displays options for signing up or logging in. When the user is logged in, the navigation bar displays options for logging out, creating a new todo, and viewing the user's profile.
